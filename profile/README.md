## 🌿+🐟 Gills & Chlorophyll - Harvesting Harmony 

At Gills & Chlorophyll, we are pioneering the future of sustainable agriculture through the innovative method of aquaponics. Our unique approach harmoniously combines aquaculture and hydroponics, creating a symbiotic environment where fish and plants thrive together.

## 🔭 Our Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize farming by creating eco-friendly, efficient, and sustainable food production systems. By leveraging the natural relationship between fish and plants, we aim to produce fresh, healthy, and nutritious food while conserving valuable resources.

## ❓ How It Works

In our integrated system, nutrient-rich water from fish tanks provides essential nourishment to the plants. The plants, in turn, filter and purify the water, creating a clean and healthy environment for the fish. This closed-loop system minimizes waste, reduces water usage, and eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

## ☑️ Why Gills and Chlorophyll?

- __Sustainability__: Our method reduces environmental impact by using significantly less water than traditional farming and eliminating agricultural runoff.
- __Quality__: We produce high-quality, pesticide-free vegetables and herbs, along with healthy, sustainably raised fish.
- __Innovation__: By harnessing the power of nature, we create a productive and efficient farming system that can be implemented in diverse environments, from urban rooftops to rural landscapes.

## 📑 Our journey
Gills and Chlorophyll is the result of a strategic joint venture between Eensymachines and Metcons, Pune. Eensymachines brings unparalleled expertise in developing cloud-connected IoT solutions, enabling advanced technological integration and remote monitoring capabilities within our aquaponics system. Meanwhile, Metcons Pune contributes its extensive experience in fabricating high-quality vinyls and robust structural components, ensuring the physical integrity and durability of our setup. This collaboration was a natural convergence of complementary skills and vision, akin to a startup poised for success. Together, we have combined cutting-edge technology with superior craftsmanship to create a pioneering aquaponics system that stands as a testament to innovation and sustainability.

We began our journey as two modest engineers from the Maharashtra Institute of Technology, Pune. 🇮🇳 After two decades of diverse professional experiences—one in corporate IT and the other managing a successful family business—we embarked on prototyping a cloud-connected urban farm. Inspired by our children's enthusiasm for gardening and growing their own food, we recognized the unique passion of Generation Alpha for returning to their roots and fostering sustainable practices. It's truly heartening to see them embrace the art of growing their own food.

In March 2024, we meticulously constructed our first prototype, drawing from our extensive knowledge gained through numerous YouTube courses and the book "Aquaponic Gardening" by Sylvia Bernstein. Our setup featured half a dozen tomato plants and was entirely powered by solar energy. We automated the water pump to synchronize with the flood and drain cycle. By June 2024, we successfully harvested about a dozen tomatoes. Although the fish in our system are primarily ornamental, they have bred new fry, and aside from a few losses during experimentation, we have managed to keep most of them thriving and content.

As I write this up we have also plans to add jalepeanos alongside the tomatoes. Avacados are tricky but someday yes we would also want to add avacados to the setup as well.
